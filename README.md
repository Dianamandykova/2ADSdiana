This repository is my example implementation of Arraylist and LinkedList.

ArrayList
The MyArrayList class implements the MyList interface and provides functionality similar to Java's built-in ArrayList class. It dynamically resizes its internal array to accommodate adding elements beyond its initial capacity. It supports operations such as adding, getting, setting, removing elements, as well as checking for the existence of an element, finding its index, and more.

LinkedList
The MyLinkedList class implements the MyList interface and provides functionality similar to Java's built-in LinkedList class. It consists of nodes where each node stores a reference to the next node in the sequence. It supports operations such as adding, getting, setting, removing elements, as well as checking for the existence of an element, finding its index, and more.

Usage
To use these implementations, you can create instances of MyArrayList or MyLinkedList and perform operations on them as demonstrated in the provided examples in the Main class.

Main Class
The Main class contains methods to test the functionality of both MyArrayList and MyLinkedList. Each method in Main tests a specific operation of the data structures, such as adding elements, removing elements, getting elements, setting elements, and more.

How to Run
To run the tests and see the output, execute the Main class. Ensure that you have Java installed on your system and set up the classpath correctly.
